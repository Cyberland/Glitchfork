They worked because for many years airline passengers were a captive audience with few alternatives. Today, potable devices help passengers stay occupied during their flight. This is also the main reason why SkyMall is being sold, according to its Chief Executive:</span></p><h6 class="c4"><a name="h.cbhftietk06c"></a><span>With the increased use of electronic devices on planes, fewer people browsed the SkyMall in-flight catalog. [This] resulted in additional competition from e-commerce retailers and additional competition for the attention of passengers, all of which further negatively impacted SkyMall&#39;s catalog sales.</span></h6><p class="c1"><span>I agree that the brand still has potential in the Digital Age. It is already associated with flying, and its catalogs are well known for their somewhat unusual products. The company which buys SkyMall could easily use these strengths to take the brand in a bold new direction.</span></p><p class="c8"><span>SkyMall was losing business because people weren&rsquo;t looking at it&rsquo;s catalogs. I&rsquo;d recommend that they shift their strategy in two ways:</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><ul class="c10 lst-kix_m4lnasten156-0 start"><li class="c6"><span>Provide information which attracts passengers to their site or mobile presence</span></li><li class="c6"><span>Create a strong user experience tailored towards passengers in the air</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span>This would require more research into the kind of information passengers are interested in, but I would recommend the inclusion of news, the weather, and real time flight information. For the latter category, one section of SkyMall might give visitors customized information about their route, the plane they are riding on, and the weather report for their destination city. Integration with social media would make it possible to highlight posts about their flight on Twitter or Facebook.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>This in-flight information could be interweaved with descriptions of products that are available for sale. These could be presented as catalog entries, or videos.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>SkyMall could draw upon its history and feature popular products from the past, top selling items, and perhaps items that were rejected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>In addition to being a source of information, SkyMall could offer concierge services which help passengers connect with other online services.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>When I searched for SkyMall on the Internet, I found a site and an iOS app which both look like online catalogs. I would start by changing to a design which allowed for multiple kinds of channels and activities for visitors.</span></p><p class="c8"><span>What are some things that you would change about SkyMall to make it more relevant to travellers?
